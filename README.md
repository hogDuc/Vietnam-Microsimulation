# Vietnam-Microsimulation
A static Microsimulation model for Vietnam.
The simulation utilizes the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey as the input. It allows users to modify different tax policies, subsidy policies, etc... to see how said policies impact Vietnam's microeconomy, which includes Government income / expenditure, households' income, expenditures, as well as Vietnam GINI index and poverty rate.

**Since the VHLSS data is confidential, it cannot be uploaded to Github. However, past VHLSS data are available for free online, and with some adjustments to the variable names, the simulation should still run normally.**
